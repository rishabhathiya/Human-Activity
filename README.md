# Human-Activity
The data was collected from 30 subjects aged between 19 and 48 years old performing one of 6 standard activities while wearing a waist-mounted smartphone that recorded the movement data. Video was recorded of each subject performing the activities and the movement data was labeled manually from these videos.
